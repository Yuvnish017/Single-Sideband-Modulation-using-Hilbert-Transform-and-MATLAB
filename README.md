This project aims at understanding Single Sideband Suppressed Carrier Modulation using 
Hilbert Transform. Simulations are done using MATLAB 2020a. In this project Single Sideband
Modulation is also compared with Double Sideband Modulation.

1. Single-sideband-modulation.m - conatins the MATLAB code

2. Single-sideband-modulation.mlx - live editor file of MATLAB

3. Single-sideband-modulation.pdf - a detailed report of the project explaining
			            Single Sideband Modulation and how Hilbert Transform
			            is used to obtain the same. The report also contains
				    some advantages and disadvantages of Single Sideband Modulatio
			            over Double Sideband Modulation.
